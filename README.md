Licenses
========

The code I've written is released under the MIT license. 

The Enron Dataset (in the `maildir` directory) is the May 7, 2015 version of the Enron Dataset available here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/

I cannot figure out how cmu.edu is choosing to license the dataset, so it is probably available freely with no license.
